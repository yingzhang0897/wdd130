                <p>Hi there, nice to meet you. My major in university is translating, and I did a pretty good job on that. I can say that not only because I did get a first-tier scholarship each year, but also becasue I deeply know the tricks of being a good translating. It is not about how hard I studied under the guidelines of textbook and teacher. It is about how passionate I was about writing. I loved use accurate words and smooth sentences to express my ideas and feelings, which laid a solid foundation for my translating study and career. At the same time, I deeply know that translating is different from creative writing in that translating means being loyal to the original author or speaker. I cannot say whatever I mean. I have to say whatever the original author or speaker means and my expression needs to be as close and accurate as possible. The is the trick of tranlating. The target text needs to be refined as well as loyal to the source text. I am confident in my skills of translating and I believe my work ethic and skills can make your life easier.</p>
