        Hi there, nice to meet you. My major in university is translating, and I did a pretty good job on that. I can say that not only because I did get a first-tier scholarship each each, but also becasue I deeply know the tricks of being a good translating. It is not about how hard I studied under the guidelines of textbook and teacher. It is about how passionate I was about writing. I loved use accurate words and smooth sentences to express my ideas and feelings, which laid a solid foundation for my translating study. At the same time, I deeply know that translating is different from creative writing in that translating means being loyal to the original author or speaker. I cannot say whatever I mean. I have to say whatever the original author or speaker means and my expression needs to be as close and accurate as possible. The is the trick of tranlating. The target text needs to be refined as well as loyal to the source text. I am confident in my skills of translating and I hope my job can make your life easier.

      <h3>How I Work</h3>
      <p>
        Hi there, I believe you have read my story, if not, please get to know me before working with me. I believe mutual trust is critical in a business partnership. Translating is a time-sensitive job, so when you send me a request to translate something for you, please make it clear how urgent it is. I would never put you in anxiety caused by my failing to get my job done in time. I have a database to manage all my work to make sure that I never miss any due date. Time is precious to me, so please send me all your requirements once and I will notify your my process at certain interval period based on our agreement.
      </p>

      <h3>How I charge</h3>
      <p>
        It is the era of AI, and a good translator knows how to take advantage of that. What makes me irreplaceble is my language skills and my time devoted into my work. Therefore, all my work is charged by hour. For regular documents, I charge $35 per hour; for the urgent documents, I charge $50 per hour. Besides, there are two discount activities: 1. the first 2 hours of each client get 20% off; 2. Book every 10 hours and get 1 hour free.
