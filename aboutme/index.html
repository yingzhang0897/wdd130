    <p>Hi everyone, I am Ying, coming from China, staying in the U.S. as an au pair right now. I am very close to my host family. I love them. Because all kids go to school this year, so I have a big chunk of time to study by myself. </p>
    <p>I do not have a tech background, but I want to persue a bachelor degree of software development. I know it can be hard, but I have faith in myself. I am a hard-working person, which means I am always working or studying. But when I am really tired, I like playing "JUST DANCE" on Nintendo Switch.</p>
    <p> I have been a memebr of the church for about 1 year and half, and I think I am transforming myslef under the guidance of Holy Spirit little by little. I want to be more and more spiritual along with my pathway study. </p>
